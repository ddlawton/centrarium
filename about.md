Hello! My name is Douglas Lawton and I am currently a [Environmental Life Sciences] Ph.D student at [Arizona State University] in the [Cease Lab]. 

I grew up in rural North Carolina, recieved a B.S. in Biology from [The University of North Carolina at Greensboro] in 2015. In 2016, I moved out west to join the Cease Lab and promote global food security.

I am a landscape ecologist who dabbles in human-plant-insect interactions. Currently, I am studying the ecological underpinnings of the Australian plague locust in Australia.
