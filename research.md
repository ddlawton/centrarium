Most Americans are unaware of the current challenges that locusts pose to global food security. Ironically, in 1874, North America experienced the largest locust swarm in recorded history with a Rocky Mountain locust (Melanoplus spretus) swarm of approximately <strong> 12-25 trillion individuals </strong>. Only <strong> 1 out of 10 Western settlers had enough food to survive the following winter. </strong> To this day, locust plagues decimate crops around the world, posing long-term impacts on livelihoods in some of the most extreme environments. However, we still donâ€™t know the ecological causes of locust swarms or what limits their distributions across continents. Overgrazing of arid landscapes changes the patterning of vegetation from continuous to patchy and impacts patch nutritional content. This likely makes the landscape more optimal for locusts, increasing their swarm potential. My research investigates the ecological causes of and land degradation impact on locust swarms to contribute valuable information to locust management globally.
